# WORMLAIR

![TitleImage](Screenshots/Screenshot0004.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme was "Single Screen Game". I wan't going to enter this month because I'm really late with other
work, but a student of mine decided to push me, and as a result I built this completely unbalanced monstrosity in his
honor.

This uses a mix of custom scripts and the [OkapiKit], a no-code kit bashing system I'm working on for the students.
